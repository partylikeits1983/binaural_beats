# Binaural Beats Generator
Binaural beats are a form of auditory beat stimulation in which two tones, varying slightly in frequency, are played into each ear, producing an auditory illusion of a third tone. Binaural beats of certain frequencies have a modest, positive effect on memory, attention, pain perception, and relaxation.

A study of 34 people [1] compared the effects of silence, a pure 240 Hz tone, classical music, and binaural beats at 5, 10, and 15 Hz on a verbal working memory task, and saw that the 15 Hz (beta) beats significantly improved performance. 5 and 10 Hz beats had no effect.

Another study in 28 people [2] used the same experimental design, but instead tested visuospatial memory, and found 15 Hz produced a significant improvement in performance. Silence and 10 Hz beats produced the worst performance and the other interventions had an intermediate effect.

### Generate Beta Brain Waves
This script plays two sine waves at 200 and 215 Hz, which results in a 15 Hz (beta) beat. Use while programming for increased performance.

### Planned Features:
Adjust pink noise level to drown out distractions while working in a public space.
